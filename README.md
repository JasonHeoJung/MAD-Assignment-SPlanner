Description of app:
Splanner is a planner for students to plan and track their lessons, their tasks for the day,
and help them improve their subjects where they are weak at. Also allows students to listen to music while doing their work.

Roles and Contributions:
Natalie - Did the layout of the timetable

Guo heng - Did the layout of to do list and subject tracker || New :  Made a music player feature that asks for permission to access storage then getting all the songs downloaded in the device then displaying it. Uses media player to play each song, there are also pause, play, previous song, next song and repeat song functions. Music can continue playing even being outside of the app for example at home screen or in play store. Uses seek bar to track the progress of the song, users can adjust the seek bar to go to the part of the song that they like. After a song has finished playing it will automatically play the next song just like a playlist. || Improvements of the previous two features: When adding task in to do list, the due date now uses date picker, When adding grade in subject tracker, the grade now uses a dropdown list, also added a remove button for each of the subjects, also added back the weakest subject feature, and made the UI look nicer for the subject tracker.
